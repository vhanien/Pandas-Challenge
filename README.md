# Pandas-Challenge
In this challenge, I have been assigned the task of analyzing the data for a fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli.

# Three Data Observations
1. Of all players (576 players) women accounted for 14%
2. The majority of players fell within the age range of 20-24
3. Although women accounted for a minority of users, on average they spent more on the game ($3.20 vs $3.02 for men)
