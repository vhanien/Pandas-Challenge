# Pandas-Challenge
In this challenge, I have been assigned the task of analyzing the data for a fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli.

# Three Data Observations
1. Volume of mice tumors decreased significantly over time as seen with mice taking Capomulin
2. Survival rates were almost 2x higher for mice on Capomulin
3. The weight of the mouse was highly correlated with their tumor size (almost perfectly correlated)
